SyobonKZ
==================
###### Original games developers: 
* ###### Chiku (ちく) for Syobon Action
* ###### Bluvel (大川和樹) for Syobon Action 2
###### Open Syobon Action developer: Mathew Velasquez
###### Developer/maintainer of this fork: +KZ (@M0REKZ)
###### [Syobon Action 2 readme (japanese)](readme_ja.txt)

SyobonKZ is a cross-platform port of the unforgiving Japanese platformer ***Syobon Action***.

It is also known as:
* Cat Mario
* Shobon no Action
* Neko Mario
* Cat MeOUCHio
* *and other names.....*

About the license
-----
Chiku released the source code of Syobon Action to allow others modifying it, however he didnt use a license...
Instead he included a japanese readme.txt with the following text:

```
スパゲティソース かつ タブが一度も使用されてないうえ、
クラスわけ無しにif文大量使用のカオスを解読できる方はどーぞｗ
ご自由に改造なさって下さい。

ただ、そのままのソースを配布するのはご遠慮下さい。
```

In english it somewhat translates to:

```
Spaghetti sauce. The tabs aren't used even once, and the code is a chaotic mess of tons of if statements without any class divisions. If you can decipher it, go ahead!
Feel free to modify it as you like.

However, please refrain from distributing the source code as is.
```

So, as you can see, Syobon Action mods based on the original code can NOT use a open source license, due to the amount of developers that modified it and the unclear license situation.
